New environmental testing standards around manufacturing process;We need to evaluate the current manufacturing processes on our lathes. We are using harmful chemicals that are not good for the environment to cool the machines. I think we should check out an organic solution even though its double the price.;Engineering- MeteorM2_Auto9.jpeg
Recall on semi-conductors from Fulltransfer Corp.;I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor material quality. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.;Engineering- 071214-radarsat2-02.jpg
New failure testing procedures;I propose we evaluate the current testing processes and increase the cycles to 100 per part.;QA- af7a66e14fafae7a6f9eb079ac37_Content.jpeg
Recall on circuit boards from Intel.;I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor conductivity. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.;Engineering- 4.jpg
Mechanical load testing on Job 00455;We need to evaluate the current manufacturing processes and material grades on Part: A0029 on Job 00259. I propose we evaluate this again in testing to make sure it is compliant.;Engineering- 4.jpg
Recall on semi-conductors from Parallel design Corp.;I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor material quality. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.;QA- af7a66e14fafae7a6f9eb079ac37_Content.jpeg
New environmental testing standards coming in 2018;We need to evaluate the current manufacturing processes and material grades on Part: A0023 on Job 00253. I propose we evaluate this again in testing to make sure it is compliant.;Engineering- MeteorM2_Auto9.jpeg
