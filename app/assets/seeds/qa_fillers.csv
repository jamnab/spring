New environmental testing standards around manufacturing process; We need to evaluate the current manufacturing processes on our lathes. We are using harmful chemicals that are not good for the environment to cool the machines. I think we should check out an organic solution even though its double the price.
Recall on semi-conductors from Fulltransfer Corp.; I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor material quality. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.
New failure testing procedures; I propose we evaluate the current testing processes and increase the cycles to 100 per part.
Recall on circuit boards from Intel.; I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor conductivity. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.
Mechanical load testing on Job 00455; We need to evaluate the current manufacturing processes and material grades on Part: A0029 on Job 00259. I propose we evaluate this again in testing to make sure it is compliant.
Recall on semi-conductors from Parallel design Corp.; I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor material quality. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.
New environmental testing standards coming in 2018; We need to evaluate the current manufacturing processes and material grades on Part: A0023 on Job 00253. I propose we evaluate this again in testing to make sure it is compliant.
Recall on semi-conductors from Ecotronic Corp.; I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor material quality. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.
