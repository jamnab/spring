User experience, website changes; the UX on our new home page is horrible! I propose we do something like this: new side menu on the left side with a collapsible menu.
Website changes, contact us; Our feedback form needs revisions, these are the proposed changes: looking into a virtual customer representative for our b2b leads
Website design for ExactEarth; I have tried this on my phone and the design is not responsive, we should implement a mobile friendly version or a menu like on the comdev site.
New poster design; The team in marketing has been working closely with the events team to come up with a roll out banner for tradeshows. This is what it looks like, and the proposed text.
Brand guidelines; I have posted our branding guidelines for the Satcom series on our local drive. Please note that these should be used for all external communication and in our PR.
New pamphlet for tours; I have designed a new pamphlet for all industry tours that come through our various locations. I think the new design and positioning of our products and services might lead to new leads.
