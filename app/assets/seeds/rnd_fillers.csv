New materials idea for Job 0566;I have come across a new material. It doesnâ€™t pass chemical testing, but it has a very good tensile strength under load. It needs to be more heat resistant, but it may be acceptable for this job.;R&D-polymer-metal.jpg
Chip defect quick fix;I have found like with a little bit of solder the batch of cpu chips for our satellite series can be fixed. I know this order is pressing;can I approach the problem this way?;R&D-soldering-a-motherboard.jpg
Electronics testing;We have been testing the electronics all day, and there are some inconsistencies. We propose we scrap the who batch of cpus.;R&D-soldering-a-motherboard.jpg
Composites vs. Aluminum casing for Job 9988;I propose we look at using a composite material for this job in the vacuum chambers. I am not sure of the costs, but the materials and strength properties are more appealing.;R&D-polymer-metal.jpg
