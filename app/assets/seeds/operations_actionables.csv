Facilities concern, no lighting in assembly area on the west entrance;I believe we need to evaluate a new lighting system in the west entrance. The clean room is completely dark, and new lighting fixtures and bulbs need to be installed asap.;Operations- ComDevUSABldg_GoogleMaps-879x485.jpg
Facilities suggestion, access cards to cleanroom facilities;I believe we need to look at gaining security card clearance in this entrance as well. A tour came by the other day and I could not believe that someone had made it into the cleanroom unaccompanied.;Operations- Orbcomm3.jpg
