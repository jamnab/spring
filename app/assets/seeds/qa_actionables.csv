New environmental testing standards to be implemented immediately; We need to evaluate the current manufacturing processes and material grades on Part: A0021 on Job 00250. I propose we evaluate this again in testing to make sure it is compliant.
Recall on semi-conductors from Fulltransfer Corp.; I recently received an email notifying me that batch 2255 is being recalled for poor material quality. We need to trace what units these were used in and do QA.
